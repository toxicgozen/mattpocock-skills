description: Turn the current conversation into a spec at the destination declared by the project — no interview, just synthesis of what you've already discussed.
disable-model-invocation: true
---

This skill takes the current conversation context and codebase understanding and produces a spec (you may know this document as a PRD). Do NOT interview the user again — synthesize what is already known and surface only unresolved decisions that materially change the result.

The consuming project's spec contract owns the destination, template, naming, status, and publication boundary. Prefer a repo-local spec file when the project declares one. Never create an external issue, apply a label, or publish outside the repository unless the user explicitly requests that external action in the current task.

## Process

1. Read the project's agent contract and spec instructions, then explore the repo to understand the current state of the codebase if you haven't already. Use the project's domain glossary vocabulary throughout the spec, and respect any ADRs in the area you're touching.

2. Sketch out the seams at which you're going to test the feature. Existing seams should be preferred to new ones. Use the highest seam possible. If new seams are needed, propose them at the highest point you can. The fewer seams across the codebase, the better - the ideal number is one.

Check with the user that these seams match their expectations.

3. Write the spec using the project's declared template and destination. If the project has no spec contract, use the fallback template below and return the draft in the conversation rather than inventing an external destination. External publication requires a separate explicit user instruction.

## Problem Statement

The problem that the user is facing, from the user's perspective.

## Solution

The solution to the problem, from the user's perspective.

## User Stories

A prioritized numbered list of independently checkable user stories. Include only stories that clarify behavior or acceptance; do not expand the list merely to make the document look comprehensive. Each user story should be in the format of:

1. As an <actor>, I want a <feature>, so that <benefit>

<user-story-example>
1. As a mobile bank customer, I want to see balance on my accounts, so that I can make better informed decisions about my spending
</user-story-example>

The list should cover the behavior needed for this spec while preserving its scope and attention budget.

## Implementation Decisions

A list of implementation decisions that were made. This can include:

- The modules that will be built/modified
- The interfaces of those modules that will be modified
- Technical clarifications from the developer
- Architectural decisions
- Schema changes
- API contracts
- Specific interactions

Do NOT include specific file paths or code snippets. They may end up being outdated very quickly.

Exception: if a prototype produced a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape), inline it within the relevant decision and note briefly that it came from a prototype. Trim to the decision-rich parts — not a working demo, just the important bits.

## Testing Decisions

A list of testing decisions that were made. Include:

- A description of what makes a good test (only test external behavior, not implementation details)
- Which modules will be tested
- Prior art for the tests (i.e. similar types of tests in the codebase)

## Out of Scope

A description of the things that are out of scope for this spec.

## Further Notes

Any further notes about the feature.
